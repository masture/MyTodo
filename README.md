# MyTodo

As the name suggests this is a Todo app.
From the design point of view, it has a UITableView to store the categories of Todo lists. At the time of creation of the list a colour is associated with the category.
By touching the category you navigate to the items in the category.
It uses following pods:
* RealmSwift
* SwipeCellKit
* ChameleonFramework/Swift

This uses different ways of data persistence technologies available from Apple and third parties. See the Commit history for details.
